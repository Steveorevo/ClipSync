# ClipSync
ClipSync is a silly little utility to synchronize the clipboard across machines. Older versions of VNC, Synergy, and various Virtual Machine (VMWare, Virtual Box) don't support synchronizing the clipboard. Simply run ClipSync on the machines you want to share the clipboard and point ClipSync to the same network file resource. ClipSync will do the rest. You can now use Synergy or connect to a Virtual Machine, VNC, or other remote deskop and your clipboard (currently text support only) will be synchronized.
